# 1. Ignore common configuration files that inflate the language count.
# This prevents tools/config files from contributing to language percentages.
*.config.js  linguist-language=
*.json       linguist-language=
*.lock       linguist-language=

# 2. Treat TypeScript configuration files as documentation, not code.
# This keeps the files in the repo but tells GitHub's Linguist to ignore them
# for the language bar calculation.
*.config.ts  linguist-language=
*.d.ts       linguist-language=

# 3. Specifically ignore the tsconfig files
# Since these are configuration only, they shouldn't count toward the code base.
tsconfig.* linguist-language=

# 4. If you decide the entire /project folder is mostly dependencies, you can exclude it:
# /project/** linguist-language=
